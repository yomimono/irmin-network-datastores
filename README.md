# Caution: Sharp Edges

This repository is pre-alpha and no guarantees are made that the code within it is a good idea.

## What Is This?

The modules in `lib/` are common code for key-value stores in Irmin used by [irmin-arp](https://github.com/yomimono/irmin-arp) and the Irmin-aware version of [mirage-nat](https://github.com/yomimono/mirage-nat).  Additional users of `irmin-network-datastores` will be added here as they exist.
